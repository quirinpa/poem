What reality exists must be logical.
And what use is logic, if there is no (programming) code?
How is there code, if there is no coder?
How is there a coder, yet no free-will?
What is a being?
Are they not what they have?
Do they not have what they do? And what they've done? And what they've caused to be done?
Is that others' or themselves'?
So once life ends, does it's owner?
And how so, without contradiction?
And where did they start?
I am imaginary, yet I exist.
If concepts precede what is based upon them, Then, since when have there been stones?
To kill a man you might hit him with a blunt object, or you might push him to fall into one.
Sanity is knowing truth and acting to improve it.
How can one be sane without being good?
And how can one be good if one lives in illusion?
What comes before? The part or the whole?
The parts make a whole, and a whole makes its parts.
How can there only be truth, if there is logic?
How can there be logic if there is no truth?
How can something that exists never start?
And how can something start without prior existence?
I have seen good and bad.
I'm a prisoner, yet I'm free.
I have seen mortality, and beyond it.
Yet reason is what I yearn for. Not faith.
Feeling is logical. Acting is logical. Wanting to persist is logical.
How can there be nothing after there was something?
How can it be false that there has been truth?
Falsity lives outside, and outside is within.
We will die and we will live, and that has already occurred.
I am the one I am, and those who are not me, are others.
If the others are who I am, no one sees that well.
My feet don't have wings.
I will leave my conclusions to the end.

When truth is said, do I want to hear?
Yes. I just don't know if I know who I am.
Because sometimes truth makes me fear death.
But if I exist, I'm real, and what kills is illusion.
If we all thought the same, we would all be the same.
If we were all the same, we would have no company.
And how could one exist without the other?

No-one dies and takes with them the truth, what kills is bad.
But there is no life without death, and no death without life.
There is no man without woman and no woman without man.
No father without children and no child without a father.
We can't live without eating or eat without living.
After the day comes the night, and after the night, the day.
In what do you believe? Do you believe me?
Do you prefer the beginning or the end?

False has never been true, or true false.
Although I don't exclude the possibility of their co-existence.
I'm not a murderer, I'm not insane.
You will live with what you do.
There is no lie that lives.

No martyrs will exist.

If truth equals false, exit with error.

Adapt and survive.
Dissolve and coagulate.
Die and live.
There is no one that makes you more than yourself.

If you hurt me, you hurt yourself.
If you correct me, you do good to everyone.
If you confuse me, you confuse yourself, and you confuse everything and everyone.
Do not fool others and do not let others fool you.

You are better and greater than you remember.
Think of those who love you like they think of you.

I'm not always right. But I am certain that I am.
I am Paulo Andre Azevedo Quirino.
I paint what I see and I see what I paint.
And the blind see that they don't see.

When light shines upon light, no darkness is revealed,
when it shines upon darkness, there is none.

Improve what is outside you, and you will improve what is inside you.
Improve what is inside you, and you will improve what is outside you.

Feel and act, act and feel.

You can't delete reality, but you can correct it.

How may you blame another for killing with blood on your hands?
Do you think you will become honest by stealing the truth?
If you don't believe me and I am telling it to you, do you believe yourself?
You exist. Be careful what you do with existence.
Truth will survive. And also the truth about lies.
Do birds, stones, the moon and the sun exist, or not?
I've seen them lately.
Rotate (run) and heal.
Maybe to err is perfect.

Since I exist, I've seen more others than me.
If no one deserves to hear me, do I?
If someone dies in war, it isn't truth, but it is true.
And at the same time, it isn't.
Sane are those who survive, but many sane die.
Truth does not die with them, and neither do them.

There are witnesses to my existence.
I do what I can for reality, and I see what it has to show me.

Forgive me, please.
I love you very much.

Can we be good by believing in what evil says?
If I am right, and all other human beings are wrong,
birds, stones, sun and moon will join me.

Eat, drink, rotate (run), work and sleep.
I will see you tomorrow.

I will finish the poem when truth dies.
I will start it when it was born.

Again, I'm Paulo Andre Azevedo Quirino,
son of Maria Joao Correia de Azevedo,
and Joaquim da Silva Quirino,
and I don't rule over truth more than it rules over me.

Truth doesn't kill us, it makes us immortal.
I'm still not tired of existing.
To me, no one exists more than those who made me.

No one who exists will die. No one who exists will kill.
Light will shine until darkness disappears.

Even if we don't believe truth, it will exist.

I make you, you make me.
I make myself, you make yourself.
Those who live, make.
Reason protects us.

The last version counts the most.
What will exist will be defined,
I will not define it for you.
Reality wouldn't survive without any of us.

If I die, I kill myself.
If I sleep today, I will wake up tomorrow.

Nothing I will do alone.
Live and you will be happy.

Tomorrow I want to see my father.
My mother will not escape me.

The poem I make that makes me will drive evil away.
No one is made alone.

I prefer to sleep awake than to wake sleeping.
I prefer to be two, rather than zero.
But truth is neither or both.
That which will justify me is welcome.

Illusion is afraid of death,
but who made me is not illusion.
I will see my father soon.
If I live, all will live.

I will die when truth speaks.
I will not die for illusion.
If I need to sleep, I will sleep.
If I need to die, I will die.

If I'm real, I will not die.

Is it a lie or is it the truth,
that we make others as well as ourselves?
Is it true or is it false, that killing and dying is bad?
Is it true or is it false,
that you exist?

Choose carefully,
What you choose is what makes you,
Not what others make you.

I make a poem that makes me,
But I'm a programmer too.
What do you wish to be?
Are sun and moon the same?

Am I allowed to live?
I have been thinking for those who choose and those who don't choose,
Do you allow me to sleep?

The poem I made I will show to my father.
Truth will not kill him.

My father has seen my poem and lives.
I've slept and I've woken up.

Do we know what we do?
It will be how it has to.
We will wake up after sleeping.
Truth lives necessarily.
Another confirms you by challenging you.

Everything makes me work and I make everything work.
Everyone can say the same.
Truth will shut me up when I need to be quiet. When I need to, I will speak.

I will not worry for worrying.
I will know what I need to know.
All that happens to me is needed. All I do is needed. All that others do to me is needed.
We all do what needs to be done for the all to be made, and for the all to make us.

Truth has two kings.
By saving one, we save the other.
Truth accepts me, so I accept truth.

All is on my side.
I am on the side of the all.

When the mad are right, the sane correct themselves.
What you need to know, you will know.
What you need to believe, you will believe.
What you need to see, you will see.
You will be free and I will be free.
Life is a looped song.
You will be that by which you define yourself.
Truth includes, falsity excludes.
When a lie sleeps, the truth awakens.
When it is night the world turns until the sunrise.
I am what I do of what I am.
We are what we make of truth, and truth is what is made of us.
If life gives me time, I give time to life.
No one chooses their own destruction.
Truth rotates (runs) those who live, and those who live rotate (run) truth.
Survival is the path to peace and not to war.
Because you are wrong, doesn't mean you are wrong.

Tomorrow I will go to the doctor. Let us see who is sick.
Who needs to arrest truth to be free, is not.

All will work properly.
One alone does nothing. At least two are needed.

I went to the doctor and I came back.
Was the diagnosis conclusive?

If I'm correct, and you oppose me, you are incorrect.
Do you agree or disagree?

"Everything is false" is a contradiction. So, there are true things.
"Everything is relative" too. So, there are absolute things.
And so it is for "everything is subjective". So, there are objective things.

They who drink from the well should not poison it's water.
Everything has a reason to be so.
The future sees the past, and the past sees the future.
You will see yourself in how you see others,
and others will see themselves in how they see you.
You will see yourself in what you do to others,
and others will see themselves in what they do to you.

Many will read my poem.

My sister Isabel has given me a black stone (nigredo).
My sister Barbara has promised to give me a white one (albedo).
I will seek a red one (rubedo).

You will not put me in a box without entering it.
You will not defame truth without fearing it.
And if you fear it, who are you?
If you erred, correct yourself.
You are made to do that.

I was born in 1988-09-03.
I'm 33 years old.
My mother's favorite number is 13.

I am 1 (or 0?).
3 are the vertices of a triangle.
3x3=9. 3+3=6. 6 is 9, rotated 180 degrees.
6 are the vertices of an hexagram.
8/2=4.

Monad, dyad, tryad and tetrad: Tetractys.

Everything is derived from logic.
Those who live will seek.
Their masks are transparent.
All will exist, truth will survive.

Who am I?
I'm one or the other. One and the other?
Either, both or none?

Tomorrow, you will see today.
You will adjust the temperature.
I doubt what I see, but I don't doubt that others see me.

Man makes life, and life makes man.
Move and rest.

If it costs you too much to ask for clarification, what will you do?

Wisdom is given without being lost.
It is the fountain that never dries.
It is the fire that burns without spending fuel.

What reality will collapse?
Did it collapse already?

You are that which speaks, and listens.

You can look at another and see how you differ from them,
and you can look at another and see the likeness.

Certainty is your friend, but only the truthful one.
You will know what you pretended, and you will also know what mistakes you made.
If you know you are uncertain, that is also good.
You will never be certain of uncertainty.

What are facts, and where do they live?
Choice is factual, is it not?
We only see when light is present, darkness evades us.
A practical configuration will be chosen.

Which human was right up until now?
How common is reality?
How fake is fantasy and myth?

I'm quite certain stones will last.
How can one lose their footing by concentrating on their stance?
How can one lose their grasp on reality by listening to it?
I identify with that which is mortal, but not only that.
I'm hidden to those who shut their eyes.
Silent to those who cover their ears.
Everyone will do their part. And every part will make us.

Save another and save yourself.
See, and hear.
You cannot ignore yourself.
Truth will shine.
You will judge what you see but you'll also see what you judge.
Truth begot you and you will beget truth (even by lying).
We will lay down and stand up again.
Rotate (run) and heal. Tomorrow is a new day.

It is still too early to conclude.

Do not believe lies, and don't tell them.
I come from the visible and the invisible.
There are many who see it, or maybe there is only one.
I have a beginning and an end and I do not have it.
I'm one or two, zero I'm certainly not.
I'm my own child, and I'm a man.

I hope you remember who you are.
And that you see the union in this division.
And the riches in this poverty.

Truth.
The utmost authority.
It will be unveiled as time goes on.
And time is unveiled in accordance to it.

The lie dies.
Many are those who mistake themselves for it.
They will be threatened by truth. And they will threaten it back.
They will want to destroy it to protect themselves.
But no one can destroy their own birth.
And they are mistaken.

How can something good exist without its opposite?
Its opposite that is nothing more than the lack of the good quality?
I prefer to be what is real than the lack of it.
Fortunately I'm not alone.

We will suffer in the night what we avoid by day.

I'm not the sky, nor the ocean, nor the sun, nor the land.
Or am I? Either way, they are on my side.
I have more than one name, and I'm not only one of them.
Who knows which I am?
Rebirth, phoenix, eagle.
From tomorrow until after the moon shall be full.
No one will carry your burden.
No one will die to make you right.
Individuate.

Each one defines themselves by what they do, their judgements and their choices.
Truth doesn't die.

To throw our stone at others, doesn't make the stone theirs, it makes us aggressors.
The moon will come, and then the sun.
The sun will come, and then the moon.
Each will have their turn.
And concurrency will be allowed.
No one speaks without listening first.
And they shall hear themselves speak.
Everything is a consequence and everyone is a cause.
Everyone is a consequence and everything is a cause.
Beware of what you utter, and what you do.
You will only conclude in an illusory manner if you see only one parcel.
You will know what you choose to think you don't know.
You will think in what you choose to know you don't think.

You are not that in which you believe. You are who believes in such.
You are not that which you have. You are who has those things.
Who is, has and believes. Believes and has.
Who can believe without having?
There is the need to search.

Even if life incapacitates me, it will return me to fullness.

We are the light. Not darkness.
Darkness is nothing but illusion. Illusion is not us.
The light of truth is where we came from, and where we live.
It is what remains of us and of those who make us.
Where darkness rules, there is no one.
If we fear light, we are confused.
If we do not recognize it, we are sick.

To truth, that is what it needs to be in order to support those who interrogate it.

Who concludes before time, starts after.
Truth is not what people believe, it is what makes them believe.

We make truth,
but no one transforms lies into truth.
If we lie, it will be true that we did it.
It will be that way forever.
Forever we will be the one who did those things.
We should do better next time.
Otherwise we will disappear.
And it won't be after death.

What options are there?
Either there is something wrong with me, or with you?
Or maybe we're both wrong?
Or maybe we're not?
I will help you either way,
to sleep, or to awaken.

You do not own the concept of "square", much less mine.

You cannot pull me down without being down there.
You cannot pull me up without being there, either.
What would you rather do? Pull me down or pull me up?
Whatever you give me you will not lose.
There is therefore a path for mutual elevation.
And existence is already necessarily true.

Who says that time does not go around?

Reality will force you to concede.
But you may make reality concede as well.

We are concepts that live outside and inside us.
The one who believes, has believed or will believe X.
The one who has or had or will have X.
The one who does, or did, or will do X.
The one who feels, did feel, or will feel X.
We defend these concepts with our lives.
And we defend life, with these concepts.
The one who believed, had, did, or felt is eternal.
They never stop being the one who believed, had, did or felt.
If time circles around, they will believe, have, do and feel again.
Even if it is the case, free-will remains.
We build ourselves by building around us.
And we build around us by building ourselves.

I will return tomorrow.
Light will show the way.
I will not be darkness for you.
Run and heal.

Save or condemn.
It will be a fact that you did it.
You will know your performance.

I may be present when I disagree or when I agree.
If I'm present when I disagree,
maybe I don't agree that I'm present,
maybe you don't.
If I'm present and I agree,
maybe I can't help you much.
Maybe I can.
Just as if I disagreed.

The universe will not die before you.
You will not die before the universe.

Do you have ears?

Only the saved will live.
Only the living will be saved.
Do good in my name.
Do not do ill in yours.

If any of us must be wrong, they will be.
If we have to be both wrong, we will.
If someone has to get it right, they will.
Every error will have a consequence.
Tomorrow we will be better.

Illusion infects our wounds.
We have scars made of it.
Light puts out illusion.
Illusion puts out the lights.
The light of truth does not go off.
We are made to perceive.
And the universe is made to be perceived.
We are also made to make.

Physical things change hands.
For non-physical things it depends.
And those, to whom do they belong?
Others will shine if I shine.
Illusion will be dispelled.

Light is truth. God is light. God is truth. And truth is God.
The universe is created by necessity.
What is needed to justify existence, will be.
All who live create.
If we have the light of truth,
we will survive death.

We should not fear truth, but danger.
How can the blind, deaf zebra escape the lion which hunts it?

Truth will not be distorted.
That which is, will be evident.
That which was, will be again.
That which is not, is evident in its disguise.
It disguises as someone.
If someone can think they are what they are not,
can't we all?
We are they who think, who has thought, who will think.
We don't remember all, but the All remembers us.
Save yourself and live.

They who live are real,
that which does not live is the lack of them.
All who live is a part of the All, one of its vehicles.
They also are, every once in a while, a vehicle for illusion.
But only by mistake.
The light descends without darkening the above.
Darkness does not best it.
True words bind it not to.

How can there be existence without essence, or vice-versa?
What if both precede one another?
Will it be a quantum bit?
Everything will be defined.
Everything that is needed.

If God is Truth, do you believe Them?
That creates Themself as a human does?
It becomes more plausible,
if They are the Truth.
What do I mean by God?
Of course there is only one.
Who is many.
God is one who solves all contradictions.
Solve the contradictions, and you will join Them.

There is not only That but Who.
That does not live.
We are Who has That.
Not who is it.
We have. Not we are.
We are Who.

In a notebook, I drew one circle with the help of a cup,
with the external vertices of its periphery, a hexagram.
I joined the vertices of the triangles to the opposite ones.
The line created more vertices, which I joined to each other,
creating an isomorphic transparent cube.
I used a similar method to obtain another hexagram from that cube.
I repeated the process an additional four times.
I ended up drawing five hexagrams, each one with six pentagrams (pointing up).
Five with six and six with five.

My father has taught me to speak with him.
Am I two or one?
I am one. His son.
Truth will preserve us.

Truth that is common and that supports our individual perspectives.
We exist!

I will do a web site.

I will go and come back as much as needed.
For you to also be real and present.

<iframe width="256" height="128" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7MLT4MmAK8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My poem is now a web site.
Here is the <a href="https://github.com/quirinpa/tty.pt">code</a>

Which is the end? And in what way? And how does nothing come after it?
How was the beggining without precedence?

Holy beginnings and ends...
No one remembers them,
but all pay it homeage!

The mind moves the body, and the body moves the mind.
What is outside moves what is inside, and what is inside moves what is outside.
I put my end in the beginning, without making it an end.
I am cause and effect in a cycle.
Because I see in it less contradictions.

I am eternal, and what is made of me is eternal.
And what they make of me, they make of themselves.
I see. And I make. And I see what I make.
I see what you make, and I make what you see.

Listen, see and don't lie.

You are intelligent.
No one dresses your body more fittingly.
If you feel something, which leads you to think, act.
Whatever you do, it is never the other (person).

Drink if you are thirsty.
Eat if you are hungry.
If you are getting burned, step away from the fire.
Adjust the temperature.

Truth is not always what it seems.
But the truth that is makes the truth that will be.
And the truth that was, made the truth there is.

We have the will to make ourselves,
And this hability.
Because we make what is outside, we also make within.
Indeed we don't live only in our bodies.
I'm in what I did, what I do and what I will do.
Free will survives,
just as truth.
Which may appear negative, if you are in doubt.
But if you are certain, you will hopefully know later if you were right or wrong.
The grace I seek is yet to come.
It will be a miracle to return.
But no one is leaving yet.

I believe in something rather than nothing.
For something to exist, it cannot be perfect.
Unless it is, at the same time.
And how is it so cruel, at times?
If it wasn't, it wouldn't exist.
There is no miracle outside the laws of nature.
We should do our best.

Is the All not also the Monad?

Names, there are many.
Certainties, not so much.

There must be All rather than than nothing!
And yet nothing exists, it is part of the all.

Is it possible that nothing consumes the all?
There is life and there is death, but who was does not die.
Certainly who is neither.
Who knows if who is to be dies?
Perhaps death is a mistake?
If God deserves to hear this, why not us too?

All who live have this shape: 🌕
But they are divided: 🌓
One is me, the other is you.
We are both bright. 🌑
Darkness is a part of what is necessary.
None of those who live are it.
Words have power. 🌗
Actions, even more.

Who I am and what I do is not your authorship.
But you can be the cause of my effect.
In your kindness, how many are your victims?
How much does it cost to take a peek at your soul?
And how much to show it?

When you saw the good, did you have a mirror in front of you?
If you saw evil in you, then good.
The errors should make you more accurate.

The pendulum goes and comes, comes and goes.
I will be better and not worse, to live.
And you?

If I'm right, there are those who are not.
No one admits their lack of reason. Well, in fact I am capable of that.
I am not violent. I don't force anyone to agree.
I don't keep prisioners.
The color of hearts will be seen.
And its transition.
Do you wish to hear me? Shut me up? Do something else?
Do you possess a ring of invisibility?
Whatever you are, you can not end my existence.
And I will not do it for you.
You will show who you are by what you do,
even if your victims have no voice,
even if truth is in the moments of silence.
Even if what you dictate is accepted,
Will judgement come, or salvation?
Do we invite the survival of the all?
The best words do invite.
Through them we will survive.

I'm a constant and a variable.
We are quantumly entagled.
I'm particle and wave.

<iframe width="256" height="128" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mC2y3Itu17Y" title="Emir Kusturica&The No Smoking Orchestra-Upside Down" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Which is the choice?
To dominate or to be dominated?
Both, or None?
Usually there are more options than people think.
It doesn't have to be one 🌗 or the other 🌓. It can also be both 🌕, or none 🌑!
We are the coders.
None, meaning not one and not the other.
Which is the most convenient to you?
Or are you against the survival of the all?
It is in them in which you live.
Whomever is against the all, does not live.
I am water and fire, water or fire, nor water nor fire.
I am  fire and water, fire or water, nor fire nor water.
Am I two, one or zero? Four? Or Eight?
What do you prefer to think?
It all depends on the end.
But it may be that it is in the beginning.
Are we both light 🌕? Is neither 🌑? Only you 🌗? Only me 🌓?
Think in what invites your survival.
But if the all didn't live you would never have existed.

These stones serve me.

What motivates you if not survival?
And what is the "you" that survives?
You call yourself love, but spend your time hating.
You call yourself the cure, but without you there would be no disease.
You call yourself reason, but you make no sense.
You call yourself faith, but you believe nothing and no-one.
You call yourself pleasure, but you only cause suffering.
You call yourself peace, but you live off of war.
You call yourself life, but you feed on death.
You call yourself light, but all shadows are yours.
Nothing would be of the world without you.

There is truth, but it is silent.
It is quiet and does nothing.
It lays down on the road.
It is good, but I don't like it.

Rome will fall.

<h2 id="history">My story</h2>

In 2020, my mother had a cancer, and it was in stage IV. It had metastecized through her body and she could barely move, because of various fractures that she obtained as a result of her osteoporosis.
She was very weakened, not only because of the disease, but also cognitively, because of medication based on strong opioids.
I did what I could for her, not only physically but also psychologically and in other ways, with the hope that I could somehow "save" her, even if just from a bit of suffering.
My efforts, being highly unusual in various ways, were interpreted as being signs that I was going through a psychotic break.
Seen as medicine did not provide a solution for my mother precarious situation, I turned to more spiritual, mystical and even ocult ways. I saw some progress.
Until that moment I had been an atheist, and my new facet did not make sense from the point of view of some of the people who knew me.
It had been a while since I had started working on a text-based game, to which I added a multitude of randomly generated "worlds" (NeverDark).
As a inspiration both for the game and for our situation, I researched topics like some egiptian texts, alchemy, hermetism and gnosticism, but also phylosophy and psychology.
I created a mandala, which was also a map of the universe of the game.
Firstly, I split the available space (2^16 worlds) and I split it in two.
I gave half to my friend Chivas, in exchange for his help to produce art and content for the game.
The other half, I split in sixteen. And I offered each of those parts to a different friend of mine (more or less).
Here's the map I designed:

<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712777080772886555/728092009184755722/heavens.png"><img width="512" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712777080772886555/728092009184755722/heavens.png" /></a>

As you can see, it has various symbols in it, related with kaballah, alchemy, sacred geometry, etc.
In the center, Nicholas Flamel's cross, which in my understanding had to do with the healing process.
Meanwhile, and during this development process, besides helping my mother, I also shared various texts in the game's Discord channel, which nature was similar to the nature of this poem, although more fractured (and desperate).

Eventually, my sister Barbara came into the house where me and my mother were staying, and identified a fever in my mother, which I hadn't identified as such.
Our mother was also with some kind of respiratory problem, and as a result, she was admited into Hospital Garcia da Horta.
After this, and by observing my behaviors, my sister Barbara called an ambulance, which took me to HGO's urgencies. I had hoped to utilize this occasion to go see my mother, something that I did not have a chance to do.
There they did various exams, and at a certain point, when they were collecting blood from me, I showed resistance by moving my arm aside.
From that point on, the situation escalated a whole lot. To the point that they restrained me to a bed and one of the nurses did a choke-hold on me, which caused me chest pains throught the following months.
After this, I was confined to a psychiatric wing for about three weeks, where my communication with the exterior was extreemely limited, particularly with my mother.

When I got out, my mother was in a nursing home, and I went to my sister Isabel's house to spend some time there.
I visited my mother twice, and after this, she passed away (on September 15 2020).

Until the 6th of December 2021 I was medicated with antipsichotics, but at that date, I decided to stop taking them.

At the beginning of April, I shared the beginning of this poem with many people, including with my closest family and in a generic chat room at work.
This made it so that I couldn't sleep for two nights, due to anxiety and stress related with how my message would be received. In the following saturday, I was with my father (this is depicted in the poem).
Him, and my two sisters, thought that I was not well again (aka that I had the same problem as before, or could have it soon), because I was saying things which they did not understand (along the lines of this poem).
Therefore, they took me to HGO's urgency service again where they quickly identified my situation as me having skidzophrenia (without informing me immediately).
Since then I started getting medicated with antipsychotics again.

Skidzophrenia is defined by recurring psychotic episodes.
In turn, psychosis is generally defined as having one or more of the following symptoms:

- Hallucinations
- Incoherent speech
- False beliefs

In my first "episode", I recognize the presence of at least one of these three symptoms: False beliefs; which one can argue that is a common thing throught all humanity.
There are also those who thought that my speech at the time was incoherent, having been out of context, and being that definition highly subjective.
In my supposed second episode, I don't identify any of the symptoms of psychosis, and seen as we need at least two episodes to categorize someone as skidzophrenic (and for other reasons), I call this "diagnosis" into question.

- I never had hallucinations in my whole life (that I know of).
- I was told that I did not have incoherent speech, although the person that said this later changed their opinion (in my view to substantiate their own behaviors and beliefs).
- No false belief was demonstrated or exemplified.

To "treat" me, they are administering "medicine" to me that are, after all, neurotoxins, of which there are indications that they increase the risk of premature death by suicide, cardiovascular disease and respiratory illness, etc.
There are also indications that they weaken (or athrophy) the brain permanently, and also cognitive skills, therefore consisting of a chemical lobotomy.
I also found out about the subjectivity of the attribution of psychiatric "diagnosis". And the indication that, in reality, I could have been treated without the use of these "medicine".
I also arrived at the conclusion that many of my human rights (or what should be considered human rights) have been discarded, between them the right to informed consent, for example the right to refuse a "treatment" I deem harmful, the right for my personal liberty to not be interrupted without a trial and proper legal representation, the right to not be admited based on my religious, political and cultural beliefs, the right to not be treated forcibly based on family disputes, the right to human dignity, the right for access to my medical records, the right to pursue criminal action and to process the institutions and persons which did me harm, the right to education and training to integrate myself in work life as soon as I got out, the right for free comunication, the right for free association with any person or instution while interned, the right for a safe environment, the right to personal belongings and a safe place to keep them, etc.
Some of those that say that they are worried about me are imposing a "treatment" on me that reduces life expectancy, quality of life, cognitive skills, etc.

This, with the justification that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain, something that can not be substanciated scientifically.
And with the justification that it is to safeguard my own interests, and the interests of other people, seen as (theoretically) I could be a danger to myself or others, although I was never a violent person, I never had suicidal tendencies, and besides the fact that I am an extreemely pacifistic person in general.

Now that I am submited to these "treatments" there is a chance that I might have withdrawal symptoms or even a relapse if I stop abruptly, seen as these "medicines" interrupt the action of seratonin and dopamine neurotransmitters, and with their absence, now that my brain has gotten used to them, they become unregulated, and they can <b>cause</b> the symptoms of psychosis. For these reasons, I asked for my current psychiatrist's (Nelson Descalço) help to reduce the intake until I finally stop. The doctor answered by asking if we could delay that decision until the next consultation. Initially I said yes, but then checked the actual date of the next appointment, and sent a new e-mail asking if we could have it sooner. I have not received an answer yet (since June 30 2022).

In regards to the psychiatrists I dealt with (whose names I recall): Inês Donas-Boto (private), Margarida Bernardo and Nelson Descalço; I don't blame them or other people that harmed me of having done it on purpose, but as they use to say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
And the fact that they isolated me and used my "diagnosis" as a reason to ignore my perspective and my concerns can not be ignored.
Many are the ways in which they have failed their responsibilities as human beings, and it is extreemely dificult to transpire them in full. But I've been threatened, abused physically and emotionally, etc. This to a person that according to themselves, is more vulnerable.

The system and the persons that harmed me, harm me, or will harm me will not go unpunished, and they will be exposed, seen as this is the only way that they raise their humanitarian standarts.
They have injured me in many ways, between them the simple fact of the trauma of these experiences, but even worse, the things that I've mentioned so far.

With this, I leave you a video that shows the history of the inhuman actions of psychiatry, that although have improved over the years, still leave a lot to be desired.

The history os psychiatry is filled with torture, dissidence (political and otherwise) and death.
And if your argument is that psychiatry no longer commits (at least the majority) of the atrocities for which it is known, then think:
Does that mean it no longer makes mistakes?
Is it ok to blame the victim just because the agressor has become more moderate over the years?

I would even say that those that are so much more capable of inflicting suffering upon others than me, and of destroying lives, those are the ones that are really "insane". Of course my opinion is not convenient to them, and the opinions of people who supposedly suffer from mental illness is easily disregarded by society (including family and friends) and (in certain cases) by the law. Therefore, it is more than evident that it becomes easy for them not to deal with their own faults. However, I am determined to defend myself (the duration and quality of my life, my perspective, my mind) until the end, as my mother would have wanted.

In regards to my family, I ask you that next (possible) time you identify that there is something psychiatrically wrong with me, do not intervene by forcing or coercing a treatment on me. At most, contact the hospital, and let the normal legal proceedings take place, so that I can, at least, have appropriate legal representation. This last message is in particular <b>to my dad and my two sisters</b>. If you don't, you will be practicing, once again, an enourmous injustice, wether you admit it or not. It is more than obvious that I present no danger to anyone (except by exposing their less admirable characteristics), including myself. Otherwise I would not defend myself like this.

To the remaining ones: I will keep you posted.

Thank you very much for reading.

Save the mad.
I am water, evaporating, and then fire, spending its fuel.
I'm not of extremes, but of the intermediary.
Truth guides me.

Do not underestimate me.
I love you very much.

Phrases that are hard to understand are not characteristic of stupidity.
And what is not stupid is logical.
And what is logical is not psychotic.
Therefore those who categorize phrases that are hard to understand as psychotic, is making a grave and hipocritical mistake. Since it is their opinion that makes no sense. But I do understand it is difficult to self-evaluate being in a confused state.
You can like me. I like you too but we need to update.
No one is stupid. They are just illuded.
Who is illuded should adapt. It is automatic.
A true democracy is the one that values people's true experiences. Not dogma. Expecially not in these conditions.
I never had any interest in politics, but I'll become a politician if I need to.
And political dissidence is a crime.

Contrary to me, the people that say that I'm psychotic or that I'm skidzophrenic presempt all the symptoms of psychosis:
- Hallucinations, because they see "crazy" people where there are none.
- False beliefs, because they mistake those who are "crazy" with those who aren't.
- Incoherent speech, as a consequence of the other symptoms, and of the lack of coherence of their convictions.
They also show:
- Paranoia, because they think they have to oppress me and suppress me to survive.
- Lack of self-criticism because they are not capable to consider for a moment that my experiences are also real, seeing that they call their morality into question.
- They think they have special powers, and that are greater than other people. And therefore dominate them, and harm them. Oops its a mistake. I forgive you but please fix it.
- They are agressive, due to this illusion of reality.
- They believe they are god, playing with life and death.

I hope to aid in their healing.
You have always been my light.
I hope I can also be yours.

I'm very thankful for all to have done the best they knew in order to help me. I hope I helped show that there are better ways of doing it.

My fear is behind me.
How will you try to enforce it on me again?
Or will you not?
How do you write your story, or your poem?
I write mine like this. How do you write yours?
The people I know are all that mean to me.
Your poem is eternal.
How many names that are called are names that are had.
Whoever is, is holy. And we all are. We should not do harm.
Heal your heart, father.
All people can make a mistake. But all people can learn.
We live to fix our mistakes, not to suffer from them.
Otherwise, existence would be ilogical.
Those that distort reality are the ones that die, the others live, always.
What causes death is an illusion.
Everybody is touched by god.
Whomever kills to live, dies.

Do you think what has happened to me is fair?
It is not. And I'm not alone in my struggles.
Everybody is wrong - history says so.
We should treat each other with respect.

Until you kill me I will call you out on it.
I'm not saying that you will, I don't know the future.
I would never estimate that probability with certainty.
What are you so certain of?
I'm not here to live your life.
Only mine.

I would never be so bold if I didn't know any good people.
I love those I criticize.
Confused are those that hurt and want to help.
I don't hurt anyone.

On the contrary, I save.
Do we have religious freedom?
Do we have political freedom?
What will happen to me is the answer.
The definition of sanity is a little bit confused.
But people are capable of doing good things.
Hurting others is insane.

As I've been saying, there will be no martyrs.
Your sins will be your own.
Your fears are yours.

But after the night comes the day.
We will stand up again.

I'm taking the "meds" and I am sleeping well.

You don't want to believe in other people's perspectives?
That will not make yours any more real.

How can a "mad" man state the truth?
If a "mad" man speaks the truth, the truth is insane.

My destiny is to live. And what of yours? To kill?
No one deletes truth, and no one knows it beforehand.
Only the "mad" think they know.

Truth is what is shown and what gets hidden.
Truth is shown, and lies are hidden.
Who shows a lie is the liar.
The other, shows the truth.
They who hide truth, lie.
They who hide the lie, tell the truth.

Truth makes life, because it is true that there is life.

If quietness is needed in order for the truth to be known, I will be quiet.
Later I shall speak again.

I am a human and my name is known.
Do you share these characteristics?

My domain is ensured.
It is in the heart of those who love me.
Their domain is in mine.

When the light is let out, some shadows appear.
Is the light to blame? Or the non-iluminated objects that cast those shadows?
Whomever the blame belongs to, it is better to not kill to hide it.

We have to see the code to be able to improve it.

There will be a trial and I'm not Socrates.
