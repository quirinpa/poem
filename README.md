# Programmer's poem

This poem is available [here](https://tty.pt).

Those versions may be updated more often.

Perhaps now that is under version control it is easier to translate properly.

There are 1\*.txt files for various languages. The 1.txt file is pt\_PT. Other versions are in the format 1-{LOCALE}.txt.

Currently the Persian version and the French version were translated mostly automatically. I will need help to translate them properly.
